| 02-02-2023 | Definition and Properties of Blockchain | Definition: A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, also known as blocks, that are linked and secured using cryptography. Properties: a. Cryptographically linked, b. Decentralized, c. Distributed database, d. Immutable ledger |
| 02-02-2023 | Structure of Blockchain | Structure: The blocks in a blockchain are cryptographically linked, forming a chain. The first block in a blockchain is called the Genesis block. Each block contains important information such as the transaction details, timestamps, and a unique code known as a hash. The hash of each block is linked to the hash of the previous block, providing a secure and tamper-proof chain of blocks. |
| 02-02-2023 | Mining in Blockchain | Mining: Mining is the process of adding new blocks to the blockchain. Miners are responsible for verifying transactions, adding them to a block, and then adding the block to the blockchain. As a reward for their efforts, miners receive cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. |
