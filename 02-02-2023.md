# Blockchain

## Definition
A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, also known as blocks, that are linked and secured using cryptography.

## Properties
- Cryptographically linked: The blocks in a blockchain are linked together using cryptography, which provides security and integrity to the data stored in the blockchain.
- Decentralized: A blockchain operates on a distributed database, meaning there is no central authority controlling the transactions.
- Distributed database: The blockchain has a copy that is present with respect to every person involved in the transactions.
- Immutable ledger: The blockchain operates on an immutable ledger, meaning once data is stored in a block, it cannot be altered or deleted.

## Structure
The blocks in a blockchain are cryptographically linked, forming a chain. The first block in a blockchain is called the Genesis block. Each block contains important information such as the transaction details, timestamps, and a unique code known as a hash. The hash of each block is linked to the hash of the previous block, providing a secure and tamper-proof chain of blocks.

## Mining
Mining is the process of adding new blocks to the blockchain. Miners are responsible for verifying transactions, adding them to a block, and then adding the block to the blockchain. As a reward for their efforts, miners receive cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin.

## Conclusion
Blockchain is a secure and decentralized technology that provides a secure and tamper-proof ledger for storing data. The cryptographic linking of blocks and the use of a distributed database makes it a reliable and robust technology for storing and transferring data.
